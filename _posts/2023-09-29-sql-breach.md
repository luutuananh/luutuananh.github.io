## Microsoft warns of cyber attacks attempting to breach cloud via SQL Server instance

### Summary

Microsoft has warned of a recent wave of cyber attacks that are attempting to breach cloud environments via SQL Server instances. The attackers are exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability to gain access to the SQL Server instance, and then attempting to move laterally to additional cloud resources by abusing the server's cloud identity.

### Microsoft's response

Microsoft has said that it has not found any evidence to suggest that the attackers have been successful in any of these attacks, but it is urging customers to take steps to protect their environments, such as patching their SQL Server instances and implementing strong authentication and authorization controls.

### Attack techniques

The attackers are using a variety of techniques to conduct reconnaissance, download executables and PowerShell scripts, and set up persistence. The ultimate goal of the operation appears to have been to abuse the token to perform various operations on cloud resources.

### Recommendations

This development underscores the growing sophistication of cloud-based attack techniques. Organizations should take steps to protect their cloud environments by implementing strong security controls and monitoring their systems for suspicious activity.

Here are some additional tips for protecting your cloud environment from cyber attacks:

* Use a cloud security posture management (CSPM) tool to identify and remediate security risks in your cloud environment.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization controls for all users and applications.
* Monitor your cloud environment for suspicious activity and respond to incidents quickly.
* Keep your software up to date, including your cloud platform and all applications running on it.
* Educate your employees about cybersecurity best practices.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your cloud environment from cyber attacks.
